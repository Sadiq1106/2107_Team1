1	@DennisOkari @ntvkenya Why not import the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine? #ShotofHope
1	@AugustusRotter To be accurate Moderna and Pfizer created their mRNA vaccine creation platforms for applications like this. The platforms already existed at the advent of covid-19 that's why it was possible to get a vaccine approved within a year. Creating it only took days.
0	@tinkernurse What is it with you?You constantly post about the greatness of Pfizer and the side effects of AZ.Are you sick in  the head compulsive or do you have some VESTED interest in mouthing off against the AZ vaccine?

0	@ctahan Because I' ll have to wait for Pfizer vaccine therefore increasing the odds that I may catch covid. I am not eligible now for the Pfizer vaccine...
1	@greta Does he have a variant? The Russian vaccine uses a slightly different spike protein than moderna and Pfizer vaccines which use a slightly different spike protein  than j and j and novavax.  Some think the one in the Russian vaccine will work less well against variants.

0	@DaveMilbo Why not just wear one in all public indoor spaces? I'd rather that than snap lockdowns every time there's a few cases. Look at Singapore they haven't relaxed their mask rules and haven't had a lockdown since July 2020 even though there's a few community cases ever so often
